<h3> By: Jessica Jaczynski</h3>
<p>
    It was a dark night and a black shadow suddenly darted across the roofs of the quiet village. The shadow looked like
    a man; up and down it went, jumping over chimneys and turrets, until it reached the tallest building in the village,
    the Church House. Then it became more apparent that it was a young man dressed in black, from his shoes to his
    hoodie. Moving as silently and quickly as a fox, he seemed to be about twenty years old. Locks of blonde hair fell
    across his thin face showing bright blue eyes filled with determination.
</p>
<p>
    When he had almost reached the end of the Church House roof, he heard a hatch creaking open on his far left side. A
    sturdy woman jumped out and headed towards him. The woman had an object clutched in one hand, leaving her other
    hand closed tightly in a fist by her side. As the woman came nearer, Kwan saw that the object was a small but deadly
    dart-gun. Unfortunately, Kwan realized that he did not have a chance, so he scanned his surroundings for a way off
    the roof.
    His eyes slowly fell on a hatch door on his far right side similar to the one that the woman had emerged from. Kwan
    knew he had to do something to stall her, but he had nothing on him except for a pepper spray that he rarely used.
</p>
<p>
    “Oh, I’m not scared of you. Come here you ugly bear!” Kwan taunted.
</p>
<p>
    “Yeah right,” the henchwoman said and then, she charged. But Kwan was ready. He held the spray can out and shot it
    in her eyes as she came near him. “Aaaah, my eyes! What did you do to me, I can’t see anymore!”the woman moaned.
    While the henchwoman stumbled around, Kwan dashed towards the hatch. Unfortunately, the henchwoman was hardy and was
    gradually gaining her eyesight back. Because of this, Kwan wondered what was going to happen to him, and muttered to
    himself, “Remember who you are doing this for.” Then he thought of who had actually brought him into this
    predicament. His love for his sweet Jane who was now dead and all of this because of his girlfriend’s previous
    boyfriend, who had turned mad and had murdered her! Alas, he could not do anything in the past; he could only try to
    find revenge for Jane in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Yet he stayed strong and dived down into the hatch. He quietly landed on the floor next to a key that was surrounded
    by a laser box. He looked around at the church walls. There were beautiful paintings covering the walls, but the roof
    was special.
    It had a tiled list of all the people that died that year and why. “And there it is, the name of my poor Jane.” he
    sighed. It was right in the middle panel staring down at him. Just the sight of her name made him tear up. “Come on
    Kwan, remember your goal, and don’t get distracted by anything. Nothing yet...” he muttered to himself. He slowly
    lowered his hand. Inside the laser cube, he carefully grasped the key. “Can’t hope for anything.” Then, he pulled
    the key out of the lasers. “Careful!” he whispered to himself several times. He started to creep away but realized
    something important. “Getting a secret key should not be that easy. That doesn’t make sense at all; there must be
    some trap here!” he wondered out loud.
</p>
<p>
    “Hello,” a mysterious voice burst out suddenly, “I’m the Terror, but you’ll know me as Josh.” A dark purple
    substance, similar to a haze of some sort started to pour out of a vent in the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
    “Woah!” yelped a startled Kwan. He jumped back with fright while trying to keep the key safe. Sadly, he fumbled with
    the key and dropped it. It skittered across the floor and went into a sewer. Kwan cursed.
</p>
<p>
    “No, this can’t be happening. I was so close!” Kwan roared at the purple ceiling. “ You think I don’t know about the
    key, do you? Oh, I know all about the key; about how I would have had a big advantage over you, Josh because it
    contains important information. I know that the key was hollow so a USB port could be hidden. And I even know that
    the USB port user could learn how to kill you. I know that your only weakness was your memories. I don’t know why
    but I know! I could avenge Jane by killing you, you jealous monster, but now I can’t because you made me lose the
    key!”
</p>
<p>
    “Awww, what a nice speech, so heartfelt. You know, I can kinda understand what Jane liked about you. You look so
    handsome when you rage about unfairness and worldly problems. Where was I? Oh yeah! One sec...there, I am ready.
    You are wasting my time and now that you are done, it is my time to get angry. Do I look like I care! No! Would you
    just shut up!” retorted the voice. It was like a command. The purple haze drifted towards Kwan and began beating him
    up.
</p>
<p>
    “No, I won’t give up, I will fight till my death!” Kwan firmly stated, “For Jane!” Then the fight started. After
    some time though, Kwan started to lose his side of the battle.
    “Aah, I can’t do this anymore! Help! Someone help me!” Kwan cried in vain.
    “Whatever, I’ve had enough! He’s a weak fighter, and I was looking for some excitement. Leave him to rot.” said the
    bored Terror. The controlled haze departed and left Kwan all alone; <strong>not dead, but barely
    living</strong>...<br>
