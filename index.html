        <strong>About Me, Jessica Jaczynski!!! :)</strong><br>
        <br>
        I live in Sunnyvale, California with my parents. I do Kung Fu with my dad after school and compete in
        competitions. The first picture is a family performance that me and my dad did some time ago. In my
        spare time, I love going to the park to practice and play. But going to the park is only one of many things I
        like to do! For example, I go to Chinese class every week and I love reading! At school, I take writing
        and gardening clubs. The gardening club lets me go outside to plant and relax. I also love animals and hanging
        out with my friends.
