        <em>Dear Caryse,</em><br>
         <br>
        I hope you had a great Easter at home! Sorry for the late wishes, time flew by and I realized that it was already Wednesday.<br>
Now you are probably wondering why I did this. It is Spring Break for me, and my dad wanted me to do some coding. So I am learning HTML and CSS! I am very excited because I will be able to make my own web page! Then I can share it with all my friends. I am really sad that we cannot see each other soon but staying safe and healthy is all that matters. Enough of me blabbering, but I hope we can talk more via facetime or email! =)<br>
 <br>
<em>Your BFF!,</em><br>
JJJJJessica and Jessicaaaaa!<br>
 <br>
PS: Say hi to Mason and your parents for me!
