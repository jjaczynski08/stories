    <em>Dear Caryse,</em><br>
    I hope you had a great Easter at home! Sorry for the late wishes, time flew by and I realized that it was already
    Wednesday!

    Now you are probably wondering why I did this. It is Spring Break for me, and my dad wanted me to do some coding. So
    I am learning HTML and CSS! I am very excited because I will be able to make my own web page! Then I can share it
    with all my friends. I am really sad that we cannot see each other soon but staying safe and healthy is all that
    matters. Enough of me blabbering, but I hope we can talk more via facetime or email! =)
</p>
<em>Your BFF!,</em><br>

    JJJJJessica and Jessicaaaaa!

<h3>PS: Say hi to Mason and your parents for me!</h3>
